      <h2>Key Moments</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>2014 Attack</h3>
        <p>Mpeketoni is a farming area, not a popular tourist resort like the nearby Lamu island, and the attack took the country and security agencies by surprise.

In the past, terror groups have concentrated on Kenya's major towns and cities, or targeted foreign tourists in order to gain maximum international publicity.

According to reliable accounts, the attackers were well organised, and as soon as they finished their mission, they disappeared, supporting the theory that they may be locals</p>

        <h3>2016 Reflections</h3>
        <p>Memorial events were held in 2016 to honor the victims. Survivors shared their stories, calling for justice, unity, and remembrance.Under Kenyan law, suspects can only be held for more than 24 hours with the permission of the court. In Tana River, security officers detained at least 60 people at Gamba Police station and held them without food for more than 24 hours without permission of a court, forcing them to sleep on cold concrete floors in very small, overcrowded and unsanitary cells. In Lamu County, police detained 41 people and held all of them in a small and filthy cell at Mpeketoni Police station for between three days and two weeks</p>
